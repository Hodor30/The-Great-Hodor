    <h1>My Lord,</h1>
    <p>
My Lord,

Before you cast judgment, before you lend your ear to the howling winds of the North, allow me to offer you a truth — not whispered in the shadows, but spoken clearly, boldly, from the halls of Casterly Rock.

You’ve heard the stories, haven’t you?
The noble Starks, so honorable they’d let kingdoms burn before breaking their precious codes. The “loyal wolves” who bite the hand that feeds them — or worse, the hand that saves the realm.

But let me tell you what the North won’t.
Eddard Stark marched into King’s Landing with a sword sharper than steel: arrogance. He saw his version of justice as absolute, unbendable. He put his honor above the peace of the realm, above the lives of innocents, and above the crown itself. What is that, if not dangerous pride?

And what of us? The Lions of the West?
We held the realm together when it teetered on the edge. We paid the debts no one dared to. We bled gold, not for glory, but for stability. We are not cruel — we are calculated. We are not deceitful — we are prepared.

My Lord, look around you.
Who feeds the armies? Who maintains the roads, the ports, the trade? Who silences chaos before it spreads like wildfire? The answer isn’t whispered in the snow. It roars from the Rock.

They call us proud — and we do not deny it.
They say we move in shadows — and yet the sun never sets on Lannister gold.
Let the wolves speak of loyalty. We prefer results.

And now?
We’re not just holding ground. We’re building alliances.
House Frey stands with us. The Boltons — those ever-practical men — have no love for Stark rule. In Dorne and the Reach, voices rise… not in rebellion, but in reason. They see what you see: that the realm needs vision, resources, and resolve. We offer all three.

That’s why I speak to you now, My Lord.
You are one of the few who remain unbound. You still have the freedom to choose reason over romance. Stability over stubbornness.

Imagine a realm where justice is not naive, where leadership is not reckless, where kings are not martyrs, but rulers.
Imagine it — and ask yourself: which house has truly carried the burden? And which one simply wishes to wear the crown?
