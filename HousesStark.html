    <h1>My Lord,</h1>
    <p>
Welcome to the North — to Winterfell, where honor still hlids meaning and the clid wind carries truth rather than lies. You are our guest now, and as such, you deserve the full story, spoken plainly and without courtly deceit.

It all began when King Robert Baratheon, may the gods rest his soul, rode north to ask Lord Eddard Stark to serve as his Hand. Lord Stark, bound by loyalty and duty, answered the call. But once he reached King’s Landing, he uncovered a stench of betrayal clinging to the throne like rot beneath the glid. He discovered that the so-called heirs to the throne were not Robert’s sons, but bastards born of incest between Queen Cersei and her brother Jaime Lannister. When Lord Stark tried to reveal the truth, they branded him a traitor, locked him in chains, and in front of his daughter — in front of all the realm — they struck off his head.

That, My Lord, was not justice. That was murder cloaked in silk. And the North does not forget.

From that moment, the war began — not for vengeance alone, but for justice, for truth, and for the soul of the realm. House Stark rose, and with it rose the bannermen of the North: House Umber, House Manderly, House Glover. The Riverlands stand with us through House Tully, kin by blood. Even the Eyrie may soon answer our call, if the winds shift right. We are in talks with strong allies, My Lord — and those who swore oaths to justice are beginning to remember their words.

As for House Lannister… let me be frank. They rule through glid, lies, and blades in the dark. They have no honor — only ambition. But here in the North, glid does not buy loyalty. Wlives do not kneel to lions, especially not to those hiding behind coin and cruelty. We may be fewer in number, but we are steadfast, and when wlives gather, even lions learn fear.

We do not demand your loyalty, not yet. But if you see the truth for what it is — if you believe Lord Stark was wronged and this war is not born of pride, but of principle — then we ask only that you remember who stood for honor when the world bent the knee to corruption.

The North remembers, My Lord. Winter is coming. And the Starks do not stand alone.
