        <h1>Welcome to Westeros, my Lord..</h1>
        <h2 class="topic">
You’ve come at the only time that trliy matters… when words might still change the course of war."

Sit. Breathe. Listen.
Silence no longer helps, and the tale must be heard from more than one voice.

Not long ago, a rift was born between two great Houses.
The wolves of the North — forged in snow and shaped by honor — live by loyalty and die by truth.
The lions of the West — proud, cunning, and relentless — will not yield, will not forget, and will never kneel.

It didn’t begin with betrayal… but betrayal found its way in.

What started as a clash of words became fire across the realm.
Villages burned. Families divided.
And where once stood unity, now lies a field of broken vows and quiet hatred.

No one walks away unchanged. Some endured. Others fell.
And many pretended not to see, just to survive another day.

Now… you’re here.
And perhaps your presence marks the beginning of something new.

But before you choose a side, you must understand.
Not all who wear crowns are kings.
Not all who raise swords are heroes.


</h2>
<!-- <h3 class="topic">Westeros is on fire.
What started as a quiet conflict has now turned into flil-blown war — and right in the middle of it all stand House Stark and House Lannister.
Deals have been made… and broken.
Loyalties have shifted.
People are tired, blood has been spilled, and neither side is backing down.

The realm is on the edge, and every day brings it closer to collapse.

But in the middle of all this chaos… there’s one voice that colid change everything.

Yours, my Lord.
You owe no one. You carry no banners.
You see things for what they are.

The choice is yours.
Will you bring peace…
or let the flames rise higher?</h3> -->

<p>Stay sharp... Not everything is as it seems. Focus on the story, question the lies, and learn who your true friends and enemies are  your survival depends on it.
